# members-only

This project is part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails coursework -- [Project: Authentication](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication).

Members can create posts and see the authors of other posts; non-members can only see anonymous posts. Currently users must be created from the command line before they can log in.
